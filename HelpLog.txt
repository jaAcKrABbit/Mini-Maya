pass by ref or pointer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/334856/are-there-benefits-of-passing-by-pointer-over-passing-by-reference-in-c

Pass by value when the function does not want to modify the parameter and the value is easy to copy (ints, doubles, char, bool, etc... simple types. std::string, std::vector, and all other STL containers are NOT simple types.)

Pass by const pointer when the value is expensive to copy AND the function does not want to modify the value pointed to AND NULL is a valid, expected value that the function handles.

Pass by non-const pointer when the value is expensive to copy AND the function wants to modify the value pointed to AND NULL is a valid, expected value that the function handles.

Pass by const reference when the value is expensive to copy AND the function does not want to modify the value referred to AND NULL would not be a valid value if a pointer was used instead.

Pass by non-cont reference when the value is expensive to copy AND the function wants to modify the value referred to AND NULL would not be a valid value if a pointer was used instead.
